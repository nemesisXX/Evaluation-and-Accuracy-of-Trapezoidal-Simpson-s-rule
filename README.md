# Evaluation-and-Accuracy-of-Trapezoidal-Simpson-s-rule
This code compares two evaluation rules: Trapezoidal's Rule and Simpson's Rule, and compare the accuracy of two methods based on different data. We finally find Simpson's rule is more accurate when the function is smooth since it utilizes quadratic approximation.
